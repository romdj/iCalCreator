# TODO List
- implement MicroService like architecture, more seamless routine
- identify sourcetype format and template and load-balance effectively
- Document further input/output of each microservice
- Replicate sourcePath in Destination
- n MicroService(s) / sourcePath

Super-long shot!
- integrate as lambda into fn-project? will see :)
